<h1><b>Ambiguity Resolution System</b><br></h1>
This project focuses on converting ambiguous grammar into unambiguous forms using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), the system identifies and resolves grammatical ambiguities through tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
<br><br>
<b>Features</b> : <br>
<ul>
  <li>Ambiguity Detection: Analyzes sentence structure to identify sources of ambiguity.</li>
  <li>Grammar Transformation: Converts ambiguous grammar into unambiguous forms with enhanced clarity.</li>
  <li>NLP Techniques: Implements tokenization, POS tagging, and dependency parsing.</li>
  <li>High Accuracy: Achieved a 90% accuracy rate in resolving grammatical ambiguities.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Technologies Used</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Programming Language: Python</li>
  <li>Libraries: NLTK(for tokenization and parsing)</li>
  <li>Techniques: Dependency Parsing, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Tokenization</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Future Improvements : </b>
<ul>
  <li>Expand grammar support for additional languages.</li>
  <li>Integrate neural networks for deeper context understanding.</li>
  <li>Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use..</li>
</ul>
